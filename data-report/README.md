### I. Project Overview 
The research and development team’s objective is to gather and analyse data regarding target audience insights to improve online marketing activities (i.e., number of interactions) on the CyberKid Facebook page.

### II. Problem
Low monthly interactions and low reach rate of Facebook posts are major concerns for the Marketing department because of the negative impact of decreased awareness of CyberKid Vietnam products and services as well as the organisation’s branding.

### III. Approaches 
1. Research the relationship between the contents of current posts and the level of interaction and reachability. 
2. Research the behaviours of target audiences (habits, interests, trends).
3. Recommendations and strategies based on research conducted, together with internal problems and limits.
