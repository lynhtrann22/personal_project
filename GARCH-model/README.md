## I. Introduction
This project estimates the GARCH(1,1) model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Gaussian Variational Bayes (GVB) to analyze the volatility in the stock market. In this project, we work with the dataset of the daily return values of the Australia All Ordinaries Index (AORD) from 03-Jan-2012 to 28-June-2022. 

I was mainly responsible for estimating the model by implementing Gaussian Variational Bayes and generating the forecast of the AORD volatility for 29-June-2022 with the estimated model. 

## II. Methodology 
**1. Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm**
