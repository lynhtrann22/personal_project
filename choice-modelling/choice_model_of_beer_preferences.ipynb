        "Breweries are adopting more sustainable practices year-on-year and selling sustainable products in the face of climate change. These breweries desire to define a target market that best resonates with their new sustainable products and what attributes of their product best resonate with this audience. Answering these problems allow them increase their market share by gaining new customers, influence existing customers to buy more, and help achieve their internal sustainable goals while maintaining their bottom line.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a demonstrative exercise, our study uses discrete choice modelling to inform a brewery's targeted advertising of a new sustainable beer, as well as the attributes of its new sustainable beer. In the first section of this study, we analyse the survey data to inform the likelihood of purchasing sustainable beer according to the characteristics of the individual with the choice outcome of the respondent. Secondly, we asked and analysed some research questions about specific features of the survey. Thirdly, we analysed the features contributing to spending on a 6-pack of beer, regardless of sustainability. Thirdly, we propose an experiment that studies the attributes of a sustainable beer that resonates with various customers.\n",

        "The data is sourced from Carley and Yahng's article (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204917). The researchers use the survey data to predict the willingness to pay for sustainable beer. The data was sourced from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which opens itself to measurement bias in terms of using a sample that is not representative of the population. However, determining the impact of measurement bias is ignored for the purpose of this study. The survey contains 106 question columns answered by 1,206 respondents, though notably half of the respondents were provided with the same few questions in the context of their hypothetical ideal beer and the other half of their existing beer preference, denoted by the WTP 1 and 2 classifications of questions. The source article determined that there was no statistical difference between the groups, so for this study's purpose, the groups were combined. This required the combination of a few question variables.\n",

        "* Remember that the ASC values are relative to the \"Indifferent\" option in this report. Interestingly, they are all negative, meaning that the \"Indifferent\" option has the highest utility, followed by \"SomewhatLess\", \"MuchLess\",\"SomewhatMore\", and finally \"MuchMore.\" Suppose we ignore the \"Indifferent\" choice. In that case, the utilities are in almost perfectly in order: desiring the beer much less has the highest utility, and desiring the beer a lot more has the lowest utility. This is interesting as there is no change in price between options; the only difference is the sustainability of the beer. This makes us think, are they worried about taste with sustainability or some other change? Or do they simply not like sustainably made goods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Coefficients:\n",
        "* It appears being more educated derives the most utility for the choice \"MuchMore\", having a coefficient of 0.296817, implying that the more education you have, you gain more utility choosing \"MuchMore\" than the other options. Interestingly, the order of coefficients for education is almost perfect, from \"MuchLess\" to \"MuchMore.\" This further supports the first statement that more education will give an individual greater utility in choosing a sustainable beer. This could be because education teaches people how non-sustainable goods negatively influence the environment and how sustainable goods are better for you health-wise.\n",
        "* There is no clear order in coefficients for exercise, but we can clearly see that the \"more\" choices are positive and the \"less\" choices are negative. Revealing that the more the individual exercises, the more likely they are to prefer sustainable beer which makes sense. As if an individual exercises, they are more likely to care about their overall health. As sustainable ingredients are usually healthier than conventional counterparts, it would seem logical that the more an individual does sport, the more likely they would want a sustainable beer for the same price, so let us see.\n",
        "* More income appears to derive more utility for every choice except \"MuchMore\". It is important to remember only 4 indiviudals chose \"MuchMore\" so there is a lot of error in terms of the coefficients for the \"MuchMore\" choice as the sample size is very small.\n",
        "* In terms of having more knowledge of beer, there is no clear order in terms of coefficients. However, even though we only had 4 individuals choosing \"MuchMore\", the coefficient is quite high compared to the other choices."

We can do this as the models are nested (the one with residence includes all the variables of the base model). We will use the likelihood ratio test, where the null hyptohesis is that the new complex model is not significantly better than the reference model. By the way the models are constructed, the more complex model includes all the variables as the first so it will always have the same or better likelihood than the reference. The test statistics is $2(\\text{Loglikelihood}_\\text{complex model} - \\text{Loglikelihood}_\\text{reference model})$ and it is distributed as a Chi-squared distribution with 1 degrees of freedom equal as that is the difference in the number of parameters."

        "It appears that being extremely Liberal means that you are either indifferent or more likely to buy a sustainable beer, but never less likely, which is interesting. The liberal group is very similar, but a small proportion is less likely to choose the beer if it is now sustainable. This is starting to reveal a trend that being more liberal means you care more about sustainability. The moderate or the middle political group is spread across all choices but with higher proportions in the preferred sustainable beer choices. The rest of the political groups are consistent with the previous statement that the more liberal groups prefer more sustainable beer with no change in price, and the more conservative groups are less likely to choose a beer if it is now sustainable with no change in price."

For example, liberals can push for more sustainable causes, which will cause a positive reaction their community.\n",

The reason it may have been insignificant in the most recent section is that knowledgable people take part in sustainable activities, which was would be captured in the new variable, making the knowledge coefficient insignificant. In terms of insights, this still shows that if a business educates its consumers or potential customers of different types of beer regarding sustainability efforts, it will improve the utility of an individual choosing a more sustainable beer. Thus, businesses should advertise their sustainable beers and clearly communicate how they are sustainable. Governments can also use this information to conduct research papers and advertise the health benefits of sustainable beer, which will push their citizens to start purchasing more sustainable beer, as this will allow them to achieve their sustainability goals and also improve the health of their citizens.\n",

Even with more variables, the complex model performs 0.3% worse than the basic, and is not statistically superior to the base model as shown by the ratio test. In practice, this is good news for experimental design and data collection, as recreating the basic model requires less expense and resources. However, the models only offer ~5% better guessing than the benchmark, and the confusion matrix only guesses 2 and 3 values. This performance would not offer much benefit over competitors in industry. We require superior models, which should be derived through sophisticated variable selection methods. In this demonstration though, an elementary approach was taken, where variables that look promising were determined by superficial inspection of EDA plots, and no rigour was applied to their groupings."

The complex EDA model outperforms the benchmark by ~11% and the stakeholder interest models by ~7%. The confusion matrices present a better result, where an additional value is predicted (1). In practice this means that a brewery is better able to distinguish between someone who at least claims to be much more likely to purchase sustainable beer over a non-sustainble equivalent versus someone who claims to be neutral. Still, we deem this performance to be too low to be anything but indicative rather than predictive, but such an increase in accuracy stemming from such a simplistic variable selection process shows promise that a much better performance could be achieved with more rigourous methods."

        "###### **Interpretation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic model includes age, income, knowledge, and politics, each of which have statisitically significant p-values in the context of individual t-tests. To interpret the size of the predictor coefficients they should be placed in the context of the cut-off points. The cut-off points of the basic model are:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\tau_1$=-4.1918, $\\tau_2$=-3.1461, $\\tau_3$=-1.2093, $\\tau_4$=0.6032\n",
        "\n",
        "Where any prediction below $\\tau_1$ grants a value of \"does not purchase a 6-pack\" and above $\\tau_4$ grants a value of \"\\$10-\\$12\", which is the most expensive 6-pack price range. Naturally, these price ranges do not translate well to an Australian context 7 years after the study was conducted, but the benefit of the ordinal discrete choice is that we can assume that the order and underlying choice behaviour would remain the same after accounting for inflation and currency exchange rates.\n",
        "\n",
        " Unexpectedly, the most influential predictor is knowledge of beer as opposed to income. Knowledge of beer's coefficient of 0.2302 translates to those with higher self-described beer knowledge opting for more expensive beers. This is in line with expectations, as one may assume that beer enthusiasts would be willing to pay for more expensive beers. Income has the second strongest coefficient of 0.2006, which translates to an increase in income affording more expensive 6-packs, also in line with expectations. Politics shows a negative coefficient of -0.1331, where more conservative views translates to a lower spend. Finally, an increase in age shows a decrease in spend. This is contrary to our age hypothesis, perhaps due to the possibility of measurement bias. MTurk was known to attract young college students to paid surveys, but perhaps also older people with lower incomes. That being said, age and income may be interacting in older demographics. All the same, age has consistently shown a small influence in largely inaccurate models.\n",
        "\n",
        " There is consistency in the shared coefficients between the two models, which is validating for the interpretation of those coefficients. The introduction of residence shows a negative association between rural respondents and their spend on a 6-pack of beer. Education shows a positive association, which may simply be an interacting variable with income as age may be. Sportiness has a very low negative coefficient which would translate to an increase in sportiness returning a slightly lower spend on beer on average, but in the context of this inaccurate model it should only be taken with a grain of salt.\n",
        "\n",
        " Interestingly, the complex model performs worse (41.56%) in terms of accuracy in comparison to the basic model (42.18%). This is substantiated by the ratio-test, where the hypothesis that the complex model performs the same as the basic cannot be rejected. These are pretty similar performances that are about ~5% superior to the benchmark of guessing '3' for every respondent. It appears that the cut-off points have been shifted lower, except for the highest category. This is reflected in the confusion matrix where there are some false predictions for '4' for true '3' values. While their classification of the '2' category is identical, the complex model's decline in accuracy stems from its classification of true '3' values. These results point to altering the base model in order to improve performance, potentially through retaining the knowledge and income variables in combination with others. These are inaccurate models that could not be used in practice, but the increase in accuracy may point some validity in the interpretation of the strongest coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        " In terms of stakeholder interpretation, these models only offer a slight improvement in accuracy to the benchmark. They do affirm existing beliefs that those with higher incomes and 'beer enthusiasts' will pay more for a 6-pack of beer. More interesting is the negative association of age and right-wing politics on beer spend, though these are smaller impacts potentially subject to measurement bias, and given the low model accruacies, may not be reflective of true behaviours."

        "###### **Interpretation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic EDA model includes income, frequency of purchasing organic products, and frequency of purchasing domestic craft beers. Each of their coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level, meaning that they have non-zero coefficients. Domestic craft beer has the strongest coefficient seen yet with a value of 0.6052, five times stronger than the coefficient for income. This is interpreted as an increase in frequency of purchasing domestic craft beer translates to higher spend on a 6-pack of beer. This is actually perhaps expected, as craft beers tend to be more expensive than mass produced beers for example. In the context of the cut-off points, a change in the domestic craft beer's value results in a third to a half of the deltas (distance between alternative cut-off points), representing a large contributing factor to changes in utility of consumer spend on a 6-pack of beer. This may be a similar result and explanation to the 'beer knowledge' coefficient seen in the previous question. A higher frequency to purchase organic food was also associated with a higher spend on beer, with a coefficient of 0.1488 it is only slightly weaker than income's effect on 6-pack spend (0.1553). This is interesting, but potentially explained by the fact that if someone has the budget to buy slightly more expensive organic food, the same may be true for beer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The complex model adds the household size, frequency of purchasing imported beer, frequency of purchasing domestic mass produced beer, and political alignment predictors to the basic model's set. The strength of the shared coefficients decrease, in particular the domestic craft purchase coefficients drops by 0.1800 points to 0.4252, which is still a strong coefficient. Organic purchase becomes statistically insignificant at the 5% level, and household size is statistically insignificant as well. Still, the household size coefficient is in line with expectations, where an increase in size returns a lower spend on average, explained by larger households reflecting budget constraints in big families or college student dorms. The strongest variable in this model is domestic mass purchase, which appears to have a slightly stronger but opposite effect to domestic craft purchase. Its increase returns a lower spend on average, which is expected, as mass produced beers would tend to be cheaper, so those buying them most frequently would spend less on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two models perform above the benchmark of 36%, the basic model has a 41.73% accuracy, which is on par with the models in 5.a. The complex model performs ~5% higher than the base and 10% higher than benchmark at 46.24%. The ratio test shows a statistically significant result, meaning that the null hypothesis that the complex model is not a better specification than the basic is rejected at the 5% level. On the whole, the confusion matrices are quite similar, though the complex model does have slightly higher numbers of true predictions and improves in predicting the lower spend range.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of the stakeholder, the complex model is more accurate, but it must be said that the finding where respondents spends more on expensive craft beers and less on cheap mass produced beers is not too informative. Though still, a company may want to advertise a certain product to specific audiences based on purchase frequency. For instance, one might advertise a pricier beer to the craft audience, who is accoustumed to drinking more expensive beer. Or a craft beer at a budget price may grow its market share by advertising to mass-produced beer audiences. Perhaps a model is not needed to achieve this conclusion, but the usefulness of the complex model lies in simulation of what-if scenarios that estimate consumer spend.\n",

        "\n",
        "The simulations predicts consumer spend on beer 6-packs according to 3 audiences: those who most frequently purchase domestic craft beer, domestic mass-produced beer, or imported beer. For an audience of craft beer enthusiasts, 13% of them are simulated to purchase the most expensive 6-pack of beer at \\$10-\\$12 (4), 77% purchase the \\$8-\\$9.99 range (3), and 11% purchase the \\$6-\\$7.99 (2) range resulting in an average profit of $9,354 given each individual purchases one beer of the average price in each bracket. A craft beer festival that knows its audience will be largely made up of craft beer lovers may skew their beers on offer towards this distribution. As for a festival catering to imported beer lovers, they may opt to plan for only 7% of their customers purchasing the the most expensive option compared to 60% in the \\$8-\\$9.99 category and 34% in the second cheapest \\$6-\\$7.99 category. This is a cheaper crowd. The cheapest crowd would be the domestic mass produced buyers, of which 90% was predicted to purchase beers in the \\$6-\\$7.99 category. Interestingly, no simulation predicted counts for the cheapest beer category of \\$3-\\$5.99 (1), but did predict counts for the no 6-pack of beer category (0) in the domestic mass produced lovers simulation. Again, this model only provides a 10% increase in accuracy over the benchmark, so could only be indicative rather than predictive.\n",
        "\n",
        "This genre of exercise may be useful for planning the amounts of beers at different price ranges offered at conventions or festivals, as well as their corresponding estimated profits. In such a context, it would be typical to additionally have demographic data sourced from ticket sales or historical data from the event. In a real scenario, it would be implausible to gain all of these various data points per individual to recreate this model, though this still poses an interesting demonstrative exercise. Though in this day and age, purchase frequency could potentially be bought from companies.\n",
